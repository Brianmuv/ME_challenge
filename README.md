### Mach Eight Sample Project

App that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.
​
Sample output is shown below.
```
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
​
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4
```

## Exec

- Install packages with pip: -r requirements.txt

- Run the app with command: python manage.py runserver

- When the server it's running: Open the URL given by django and enter the numbers (I didn't use a DB because it's not necessary store the nums.)
